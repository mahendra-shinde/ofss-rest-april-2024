Web Services

A service is an application that DO NOT interact with end users directly.

A Service communicates with Other services or client-application.


Types of Web Services:

Older format : SOAP (XML) Web services
Newer format : REST web services

SOAP uses "XML" for request, response and even for describing the services.
+ SOAP services are portable across programing languages   
- SOAP is heavier on resource consumption
	XML processing, validating and read/write XML documents take a lot time. (JAX-P > Parsing XML, JAX-B > Java to XML Binding, JAX-WS > Web services, JAX-RS > Rest )
+ Built in Security features (Authorization and Encryption)

REST / RESTFul Services
- REST avoids using XML for request, response and describing the services.
- REST are lightweight than XML web services
- No Built in security
- Either use HTTP Server's security or/and third party features like "JWT"
- Third party tool documentation tools : Swagger
